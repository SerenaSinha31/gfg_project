 Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm



 
 Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 
3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually X and O). The objective is to 
align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. Although it's simple, 
implementing an unbeatable AI for Tic Tac Toe involves understanding key 
concepts in decision-making algorithms, particularly the Minimax algorithm
